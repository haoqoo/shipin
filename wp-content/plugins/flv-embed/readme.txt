== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I keep getting “Get the latest Flash Player to see this player.” message even though I have the latest Flash player. Why? =

It is very likely that `wp_head()` function is missing in your theme’s header. To fix this, put the following code into your WordPress theme’s header file, right before the `</head>`:
	
`<?php wp_head(); ?>`

= Why doesn’t my flash video stretch properly? =

You need a better encoder. You can also try different settings for `$flv_overstretch` option. 

= Why are those ugly raw code showing up on my category, tags etc. page? =

This is because those entries do not have their excerpt defined, and WordPress is trying to generate one for you based on the post content, and you happen to have FLV embed tags at the top of the page! Unfortunately, I have yet to fix this problem because WordPress does not provide an easy hook for excerpt handling and I would need to literally hack WordPress to get this fixed. I will try to put this on my todo list but at the mean time, you can fix this yourself by manually adding excerpt to those posts affected.

= How can I change the location of the logo? =

Unfortunately you cannot, by default the logo will show at the top right corner. You might be able to manually add transparent padding to your png logo to shift the logo to where you want it to be, though it is not recommended.

= How can I align the video in the middle? =

Put the following code into your theme’s stylesheet:
	
`#player1, #player2, #player3 {text-align: center;}`

(for easy way of doing this, see [MyCSS](http://www.channel-ai.com/blog/plugins/mycss/) plugin)

= How can I embed a video from YouTube? =

Use the YouTube URL as the file argument when using the embed tags, e.g. `[flv:http://youtube.com/watch?v=fLV3MB3DpWN 480 360]`

= How long will it take for my videos to show up in Google’s search results once I submitted my video sitemap? =

I have no idea, but Google has already put video sitemap into action i.e. if you submit your video sitemap, they will be indexed and included in the search results at `video.google.com`.

= I have duplicate entries in my video sitemap?! =

Check the post with duplicate entries and manually delete the "flv" custom fields that are either empty or corrupted.

= I really like this plugin, what can I do to help? =
